# Live coding exercise: dynamically choosing a data structure

We are going to explore the behaviour of various Rust data structures, including
Vec, VecDeque and im::Vector.

- 0,1: insert and at the end/start of a Vec
- 2,3: ok, randomly select some elements that go in/come out at the start/end as
  well
- 4,5: random access insertions/deletions
