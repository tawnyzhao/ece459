# Lecture 5 â€” Asynchronous I/O

## Roadmap

We will talk about how to use sockets. This is relevant for assignment 1.

## Understanding non-blocking I/O

Student acts as a thread, M, individually. M has two tasks: task 1 is to sum a
list of numbers read from a file, and task 2 is to sum another list of numbers
from another file. For both cases, instructor is the disk that fetches the
numbers for M (by writing them on the whiteboard).

Ask students how they did the two tasks.

Blocking: M works on task 2 only after task 1 is done.

Non-blocking: M works on task 1 and task 2 simultaneously, and do summation when
whichever task has new numbers.

In above case, do we have multiple threads? (only one)

How about context switches? (multiple times between task 1 to task 2)

## Understanding async/await

More like programmers provide rules to the runtime executor so that it knows how
to properly do such context switches.

## future

Live coding. This example is copied from [lectures/live-coding/L05/block-on].

```rust
/*
[dependencies]
futures = { version = "0.3" }
*/

use futures::executor::block_on;

async fn hello_world() {
    println!("hello");
}

fn main() {
    // to show that async function will not be executed directly
    let future = hello_world();
    block_on(future);
}
```

## reqwest

This example will not work in the Rust explorer, because that doesn't have ssl
installed.

```rust
/*
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
reqwest = { version = "0.11" }
*/

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let resp = reqwest::get("https://www.rust-lang.org")
        .await?
        .text()
        .await?;
    println!("{:#?}", resp);
    Ok(())
}
```

## cURL

Example is copied from [lectures/live-coding/L05/use-curl-multi]

```rust
const URLS:[&str; 4] = [
  "https://www.microsoft.com",
  "https://www.yahoo.com",
  "https://www.wikipedia.org",
  "https://slashdot.org" ];

use curl::Error;
use curl::easy::{Easy2, Handler, WriteError};
use curl::multi::{Easy2Handle, Multi};
use std::time::Duration;
use std::io::{stdout, Write};

struct Collector(Vec<u8>);
impl Handler for Collector {
    fn write(&mut self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<usize, WriteError> {
        self.0.extend_from_slice(data);
	    // stdout().write_all(data).unwrap();
        Ok(data.len())
    }
}

fn init(multi:&Multi, url:&str) -> Result<Easy2Handle<Collector>, Error> {
    let mut easy = Easy2::new(Collector(Vec::new()));
    easy.url(url)?;
    easy.verbose(false)?;
    Ok(multi.add2(easy).unwrap())
}

fn main() {
    let mut easys : Vec<Easy2Handle<Collector>> = Vec::new();
    let mut multi = Multi::new();

    multi.pipelining(true, true).unwrap();
    // ^ see the side note

    for u in URLS.iter() {
	    easys.push(init(&multi, u).unwrap());
    }
    while multi.perform().unwrap() > 0 {
	    // .messages() may have info for us here...
        multi.wait(&mut [], Duration::from_secs(30)).unwrap();
    }

    for eh in easys.drain(..) {
    	let mut handler_after:Easy2<Collector> = multi.remove2(eh).unwrap();
        println!("got response code {}", handler_after.response_code().unwrap());
    }
}
```

A side note: [Difference between Pipelining and
Multiplex](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34478967/what-is-the-difference-between-http-1-1-pipelining-and-http-2-multiplexing#:~:text=HTTP%2F1.1%20with%20pipelining%3A%20Each%20HTTP%20request%20over%20the,waiting%20for%20the%20previous%20response%20to%20come%20back.)

## Exercise: using futures (advanced)

Based on
[https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/04_async_await_primer.html],
your task is to create a program that requests two webpages, printing them to
the console, and uses futures::join! to carry out the requests concurrently. You
most likely need to read the primer.

Here's some skeleton code, starting with the Cargo.toml. Solution found in
[live-coding/L05/concurrently-reqwest].

You can use this skeleton code. (It'll result in a warning about the Result not
being used.)

```rust
/*
[dependencies]
futures = "0.3.24"
tokio = { version = "1.8.4", features = ["full"] }
reqwest = { version = "0.11" }
*/

async fn get_webpage_1() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // ...
    Ok(())
}

async fn get_webpage_2() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // ...
    Ok(())
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
}
```

# after-action, huanyi, 19Jan2024

I did the activity, but apparently asking every student to do it was not a good
idea. It would be better if I picked some students at the front, and ask them to
turn around to fetch new numbers, making the polling process more explicit.

I live coded the cURL example, but made few typos and then ran out of time.
