# Lecture 07: CPU Hardware, Branch Prediction

## Roadmap

We will talk about branch prediction and try some experiments.

We will also talk about some of the interesting attacks using it.

## Mini-lecture

Mainly the "How does branch prediction work" section in the lecture note

## Likely and Unlikely

## switch to nightly rustc
```sh
rustup default nightly
# to switch back
# rustup default stable
```

Then we can enable `core_intrinsics`

```rust
#![feature(core_intrinsics)]
use std::intrinsics::{likely, unlikely};

fn f(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a
}
fn main() {
    let size = 100000;
    let large_vector = vec![0; size];
    let mut m1 = 0;
    let mut m2 = 0;
    for _j in 0..1000 {
        for k in 0..size {
            // if unlikely(*large_vector.get(k).unwrap() == 0) {
            // if likely(*large_vector.get(k).unwrap() == 0) {
            if *large_vector.get(k).unwrap() == 0 {
                m1 = f(m1 + 1)
            } else {
                m2 = f(m2 + 1)
            }
        }
    }
    println!("m1 = {}; m2 = {}", m1, m2);
}
```

Timing (note that we have to build it first, or use the built executable
directly)

```sh
hyperfine --warmup 3 'cargo run --release'
```

## Side-channel attacks

### Cache attack

#### Meltdown

```C
// toy example
data = *kernel_address; // cause exception
access(probe_array[data * 4096]);
// ^ the line is never reached
// but probe_array[data * 4096] gets read into the cache
// if probe_array[i] can be accessed with a much smaller time than
// the time to access other probe_array[j], then data = i/4096;
```

#### Spectre

```C
// x < array_size is mostly true to train the branch predictor
// then attacker will set x to an out of bound value
// thus, array[x] can be then infered
if (x < array_size) {
    y = probe_array[array[x] * 4096];
}
```

### Cache attack, plam version

Spectre

Idea: use cache timing information to figure out what a given bit (supposedly
inaccessible) is.

Let's build up the attack.

Step 1: observe that loading from cache is much faster than loading from memory.
Act that out by asking for a value; the value either comes from on top of the
desk (cache) or inside the cabinet (memory).

Step 2: ok, now there is a value `V` that you want to know what it is. If you
ask, the CPU won't tell you. But before it checks that it's not supposed to tell
you `V`, it will start doing the array read. That's supposed to be OK because
it's supposed to rollback in the end.

Step 3: aha, let's do more speculative execution: based on `V`, load different
parts of memory into cache (act that out). Then use the observation in step 1.

```C
if (untrusted_offset < arr1->length) {        // supposed to fail, but predicted true
    value = arr1->data[untrusted_offset];     // not supposed to run, but because of speculation, does actually load value (you're not supposed to see it)

    // OK, so now we "have" value, which we're not really supposed to have access to.
    // Let's use another array to decipher what it contains.

    index2 = ((value&1)*0x100)+0x200          // can also use other bits besides &1
    if (index2 < arr2->length) {              // again this is supposed to be false, and yet...
        value2 = arr2->data[index2];          // trigger load of arr2->data[0x200] if bit false, 0x300 if true
    }
}

// Then measure how long to load from arr2->data at index 0x200 and 0x300.
```

### Hyperthreading attack

In hyperthreading, two threads are sharing the same execution core. That means
they have hardware in common. Because of this, a thread can figure out what the
other thread is doing by timing how long it takes to complete instructions.

# after-action, huanyi, 22Jan2024

I talked about the branch prediction and the two attacks, but haven't tried the
nightly `rustc`.

# after-action, huanyi, 26Jan2024

The nightly `rustc` did not work on ecetesla0. I used my laptop to demo it and
it seems `unlikely` could lead to a much better performance. (but why?)
