# Lecture 9 â€” Concurrency and Parallelism

## Roadmap

We will talk about some theoratical stuffs around concurrency and parallelism.

## Amdahl's Law

Exercise: speed up reading the poem Engineers' Corner by Wendy Cope (1986) by
parallelizing. But the first verse is always sequential. How does it take?

```
Engineers' Corner
Why isn't there an Engineers' Corner in Westminster Abbey? In Britain we've always made more fuss of a ballad than a blueprint... How many schoolchildren dream of becoming great engineers?
-- advertisement placed in The Times by the Engineering Council

We make more fuss of ballads than of blueprints --
That's why so many poets end up rich,
While engineers scrape by in cheerless garrets.
Who needs a bridge or dam? Who needs a ditch?

Whereas the person who can write a sonnet
Has got it made. It's always been the way,
For everybody knows that we need poems
And everybody reads them every day.

Yes, life is hard if you choose engineering --
You're sure to need another job as well;
You'll have to plan your projects in the evenings
Instead of going out. It must be hell.

While well-heeled poets ride around in Daimlers,
You'll burn the midnight oil to earn a crust,
With no hope of a statue in the Abbey,
With no hope, even, of a modest bust.

No wonder small boys dream of writing couplets
And spurn the bike, the lorry and the train.
There's far too much encouragement of poets --
That's why this country's going down the drain.

-- Wendy Cope

HC: I think I didn't do this last time, I'll try it. So I might just let 1
student read, then 2 students, 4 students, etc. However, all of them need to go
through the first verse. Then I can measure the total times.

## Gustafson's Law

... you can read out longer and longer poems in the same amount of time.

# Live coding: thread pools

Rust explorer (https://www.rustexplorer.com/) works for
`live-coding/L09/threadpool/src/main.rs`.

# Threads vs processes

You could probably rust explorer these, but `rustc -O` works. I'd do that.
`create-threads` and `create-processes` subdirectories under `live-coding/L09`.

# Parallelization design patterns

Groups of students can pick a pattern and think of a way to act it out. Invite
students to present what they come up with. Give chocolate to students.

# After-action report, plam, 27Jan23

Yes, I did the poem thing, I think it works.

# After-action report, plam, 30Jan23

Did the live coding, threads vs processes, and parallelization design patterns.
It's not as awkward as I feared.

# After-action report, huanyi, 26Jan24

Only had time to do the poem activity, but that was fun.

Times for the poem (students were told to read as fast as they could)

| 1 student  | 42 seconds |
| 2 students | 25 seconds |
| 5 students | 15 seconds |

# After-action report, huanyi, 29Jan24

I went through the threadpool example and skipped the rest.
