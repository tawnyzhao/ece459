# Lecture 4 — Rust: Breaking the Rules for Fun and Performance

## Roadmap

We will talk about mutex, reference-counting pointers, and lifetimes.

## Reference Counted

### Mutex

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
fn main() {
    let m = Mutex::new(5);
    {
        let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();
        *num = 6;
    }
    println!("m = {:?}", m);
}
```

### Rc

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let rc = Rc::new(5);
    let rc_clone = rc.clone();
    println!("rc      : {:?}", rc);
    println!("rc_clone: {:?}", rc_clone);
}
```

## Atomic Reference Counted and sharing between threads

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let v = 5;
    let arc = Arc::new(Mutex::new(v)); // Is v moved? try print it out at the end

    // Exercise (10 minutes)
    // Can you clone the `arc` and pass it to a worker thread
    // Inside the worker thread, set the value to 4.

    // Answer:
    // let arc_clone = arc.clone();
    // println!("arc contains {}", arc.lock().unwrap());
    // let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
    //     let mut vv = arc_clone.lock().unwrap(); // Can we use arc instead of arc_clone here?
    //     *vv = 4;
    // });
    // handle.join().unwrap();
    // println!("arc contains {}", arc.lock().unwrap());

    // println!("v contains {}", v);
}
```

### Exercise: with String (if we have time)

Fix the following code so that we can modify the `s` from both threads.

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;
use std::time;

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("start\n");

    let mutex = Mutex::new(s);

    let h = thread::spawn(|| {
        for _i in 0..2 {
            mutex.lock().unwrap().push_str("child thread\n");
            thread::sleep(time::Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });

    for _i in 0..2 {
        mutex.lock().unwrap().push_str("main thread\n");
        thread::sleep(time::Duration::from_millis(1));
        // when the mutex guard is dropped?
        // See https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/destructors.html#drop-scopes
    }

    h.join().expect("fail to join handle");
    println!("{}", mutex.lock().unwrap());
}
```

So use `Arc` and then move a cloned mutex into the subthread would work.


## Lifetimes

### scope

An example from <https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html>

```rust
// Lifetimes are annotated below with lines denoting the creation
// and destruction of each variable.
// `i` has the longest lifetime because its scope entirely encloses
// both `borrow1` and `borrow2`. The duration of `borrow1` compared
// to `borrow2` is irrelevant since they are disjoint.
fn main() {
    let i = 3; // Lifetime for `i` starts. ────────────────┐
    //                                                     │
    { //                                                   │
        let borrow1 = &i; // `borrow1` lifetime starts. ──┐│
        //                                                ││
        println!("borrow1: {}", borrow1); //              ││
    } // `borrow1 ends. ──────────────────────────────────┘│
    //                                                     │
    //                                                     │
    { //                                                   │
        let borrow2 = &i; // `borrow2` lifetime starts. ──┐│
        //                                                ││
        println!("borrow2: {}", borrow2); //              ││
    } // `borrow2` ends. ─────────────────────────────────┘│
    //                                                     │
}   // Lifetime ends. ─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### dangling reference

See <https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html#preventing-dangling-references-with-lifetimes>

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;

    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &x;
    }

    // x is dropped, r is invalid
    println!("r: {}", r);
}
```

### struct (advanced)

Code based on
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime/struct.html>

```rust
// A type `Borrowed` which houses a reference to an
// `i32`. The reference to `i32` must outlive `Borrowed`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Borrowed<'a>(&'a i32); // tuple struct

// Similarly, both references here must outlive this structure.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct NamedBorrowed<'a, 'b> {
    x: &'a i32,
    y: &'b i32,
}

fn main() {
    let x = 18;
    let y = 15;

    let single = Borrowed(&x);
    let double = NamedBorrowed { x: &x, y: &y };

    println!("x is borrowed in `{:?}`", single);
    println!("x and y are borrowed in `{:?}`", double);
}
```

### use Drop trait

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyInt {
    x: i32,
}

impl Drop for MyInt {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropping: {:?}", self);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = MyInt{x: 20};
    let x_ref = &x;
    let x = MyInt{x: 17}; // Shadowing the previous `x`
    println!("x_ref={:?}, x={:?}", x_ref, x);
    // let's see when the first x is dropped
}
```

### references as input and output

Both `string1` and `string2` **have to be** `String`s, since we need to make
sure the `string2` will be dropped when it goes out of scope. In terms why it
fails to compile, so although as a human, we see the `result` is still valid
when we print it since it always points to `string1`, the compiler cannot see
that. The compiler will consider the `result` points to an invalid value
whenever either `string1` or `string2` is dropped. (I see references in pairs,
of course here are three pairs: `x,y`; `x,returned result`; `y,returned result`.
For any pair, if the two references are with the same lifetime, say `'a`. Then
it means we tell the compiler that if one reference becomes invalid, then it can
just assume another also becomes invalid; or if one is alive then the other has
to be alive)

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("abcd");
    let result;
    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
    }
    println!("The longest string is {}", result);
}
```

Note that this is **DIFFERENT** from the one in the lecture note, which uses
`&str` for `string2`. In that case, `string2` itself is just a reference, but
not the owner. Therefore, the underlying value will not be dropped.

Also, mention the existence of the static lifetime.

### Exercise: lifetimes (advanced)

Read
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html#lifetime-elision>
and try to expand the following functions

```rust
fn print(s: &str);                                   // elided

fn debug(lvl: usize, s: &str);                       // elided

fn substr(s: &str, until: usize) -> &str;            // elided

fn new(buf: &mut [u8]) -> Thing;                     // elided
```

## Unsafe

### split a slice into two mutable slices

See
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#creating-a-safe-abstraction-over-unsafe-code>

```rust
use std::slice;

fn split_at_mut(values: &mut [i32], mid: usize) -> (&mut [i32], &mut [i32]) {
    let len = values.len();
    let ptr = values.as_mut_ptr();

    assert!(mid <= len);

    // (&mut values[..mid], &mut values[mid..])
    // ^ Rust's borrow checker can't understand that we're borrowing different
    // parts of the slice; it only knows that we’re borrowing from the same
    // slice twice.

    unsafe {
        (
            slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr, mid),
            slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr.add(mid), len - mid),
        )
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut vector = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    let (left, right) = split_at_mut(&mut vector, 3);
    // ^ we don't need to wrap the call in an unsafe block
    println!("{:?}", left);
    println!("{:?}", right);
}
```

### Exercise: Unsafe (advanced)

Try to split a given i32 vector into two slices using a raw pointer. (Exercise is based on
https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#creating-a-safe-abstraction-over-unsafe-code
and Listing 19-7: Creating a slice from an arbitrary memory location)

```rust
use std::slice;

fn main() {
    let size = 5;

    // create a i32 vector with `size` capacity
    // let v = ...

    // get its `address` by `as_mut_ptr`
    // let address = ...
    // convert `address` to a raw pointer `r`
    // let r = ...

    let len = 5; // the split position
    // TODO: ^ try increase the `len` to create a segment fault
    // can `len = 6` cause a segment fault?

    let values: &[i32] = unsafe {
        slice::from_raw_parts_mut(r, len)
    };

    println!("{}", values[len - 1]);
}
```

## Challenge: can you make a cycle with Rc (you also need to understand RefCell)?

(It's harder than it looks.)

# after-action, huanyi, 15Jan2024

I think I went a little bit slower than expected. I only covered "lifetime:
scope".

One student asked about why we need `Arc`, why can't we just use mutex after
class. Probably I should talk more about `Sync` trait and `Send` trait. Also,
not many student worked out "Exercise: with String".

# after-action, huanyi, 19Jan2024

I didn't cover any of the thing marked "advanced". I showed the unsafe example
but didn't go into details.
