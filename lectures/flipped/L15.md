# Lecture 15 â€” Rate Limits

## Roadmap

We will talk about if something is not under our control, what we can do.

## Intro

Have you seen a response code of 429? Where and how did you see it?

Talk about the ideas in the lecture note.

Can we think more? What about if it happens anyway?

## ratelimit::Ratelimiter

https://docs.rs/ratelimit/latest/ratelimit/

```rust
/*
[dependencies]
ratelimit = "0.9.0"
*/

use ratelimit::Ratelimiter;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    // constructs a ratelimiter that generates 1 tokens/s with no burst
    let ratelimiter = Ratelimiter::builder(1, Duration::from_millis(1000))
        .build()
        .unwrap();

    for _ in 0..10 {
        // a simple sleep-wait
        if let Err(sleep) = ratelimiter.try_wait() {
            std::thread::sleep(dbg!(sleep));
            continue;
        }

        // do some ratelimited action here
        // e.g.,
        println!("I have a token!");
    }
}
```

How many prints do you see?

## TODO

Use `Ratelimiter` in multiple threads.

# After-action report, huanyi, 09Feb24

I talked about the ideas presented in the lecture note, but also had a
discussion on what additional thing can be done. For instance, we can fake
multiple accounts, or if needed, use more than one third-party services at the
same time or switch to another better one with higher limit.

I ran the code example. It would be good to talk about its implementation.
