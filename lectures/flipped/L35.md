# Lecture 35 â€” DevOps: Operations

## Roadmap

I thought of 3 potential exercises in this DevOps space. We can look at them and
decide which order to do them in (and how many to do). The first two are based
on L34 note.

## Naming

Let's develop a naming scheme for our herds of (literal) cows. How can we apply
the principles in the lecture to this problem?

## Dockerization

This is pretty cookbook, but you can follow these instructions for creating a
Docker image of a Node.js application.

<https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/>

## GitHub Actions

I figured out how to use GitHub Actions to compile the TeX files automatically.
Probably the easiest CI thing is to run test cases for a project automatically.
Pick some Java project and set up a GitHub action for it.

See: <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart>

## GitLab CI/CD

See: <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/>

We can probably try both GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD

## A Real Incident

We can talk about how it can be avoided:

# After-action report, plam, 3 Apr 2023

Did the naming exercise. Did not do the other exercises. Instead, we
collectively talked through an example of writing an incident report (fake,
"patricklam.ca is down"). That works as an exercise, though maybe one could read
an existing incident report also. Or have a better scenario.

# After-action report, huanyi, 1Apr24 & 5Apr24

The xz incident can be extended further I think. On Apr 5th, we tried both
GitHub Action and GitLab CI/CD. UW GitLab needs us to set up a separate runner
to do jobs. I used my own laptop for it. Its tutorial was not very
straightforward.
