# Lecture 03: Rust: Borrowing and threads

## Roadmap

We will talk about more Rust concepts and do some practice.

## Intro

`ref` are immutable by default, but you can explicitly create mutable ones.

```rust
let mut s1 = String::from("Hello World!") // mind the `mut`
let s = &mut s1;
```

1. While a mutable reference exists, the owner can't change the data.
2. There can be only one mutable reference at a time, and while there is, there
   can be no immutable references.

Make them simple:

1. There can be only one write
2. No read when a write exists

## Borrowing example

```rust
fn main() {
  let s = String::from("hello");
  let len = calculate_length(&s); // lend s to callee
  println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // borrowed s
  s.len() // no semicolon needed (explain the difference between Rust and C)
}
```

## Can also mutably borrow

```rust
// ...
// let mut s = String::from("hello");  // it should be mutable
// let len = calculate_length(&mut s);
// ...

fn calculate_length(s: &mut String) -> usize {
  s.push('0');
  s.len()
}
```

### Exercise: convert this code to not use borrowing (5 minutes)

```rust
fn main() {
  let v = vec![String::from("q"), String::from("r")];
  let len = calculate_length(&v);
  println!("The length of '{:?}' is {}.", v, len); // :? means we want to use the Debug trait
                                                   // maybe expand more on the trait concept here if we have time
}

fn calculate_length(v: &Vec<String>) -> usize {
  v.len() // note: return last expression in fn
}
```

One way of doing it is to simply use `.clone()`

## Thread example

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
  let handle = thread::spawn(|| { // closure
    for i in 1..10 {
      println!("hi number {} from the spawned thread!", i);
      thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
  });

  for i in 1..5 {
    println!("hi number {} from the main thread!", i);
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
  }
  handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

### Beware, you will encounter this

The above does not have data moved between threads. Otherwise, it will be much
more complex. Concurrency problems can happen when we have the same value shared
among multiple threads, but the changes on it do not follow a pre-defined order.
Let's see how Rust can solve it with the ideas of ownership and borrowing.

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
  let v = vec![1,2,3];

  let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
    println!("Here's a vector: {:?}", v);
  }); // the `|| println!(...)` part is a closure, i.e., an anonymous function

  handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

We need to add `move` to make the above code to work. That said, only one thread
can own the value at a time, which help us avoid concurrency problems.

## Message passing example

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
  let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

  thread::spawn(move || {
    let val = String::from("hi");
    tx.send(val).unwrap(); // Think: why can we use `tx` here?
  });

  let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
  println!("Got: {}", received);
}
```

### Exercise: Message passing challenge (10 minutes)

Modify the above example so that the created thread takes two ints from main(),
adds them, and passes the sum back along the channel.

I talked about the rules for `ref`s. Then I let students try to find a
counter-example to violate the rules. That was a ten-minute exercise.

One student asked about why he was able to have a mutable reference in scope
while still be able to modify the owner. It was because the compiler is smart so
it knows the reference will not be used anymore!

One student came with a cool solution for the "to not use borrowing" exercise.
He just return back `(v, v.len())`.

I was only able to do a live-coding of the thread example but not explain it
much (that was the last five minutes). Someone asked about what's `unwrap`.

# after-action, huanyi, 15Jan2024

I finished the rest, explained `unwrap`, and also had students tried the
exercise.

I also talked about `dbg!`, but very briefly.
